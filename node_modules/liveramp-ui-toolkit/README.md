# UI Toolkit

A collection of UI components for LiveRamp web applications.
https://git.liveramp.net/pages/RailsRepos/ui_toolkit/index.html

## Usage


Set your local npm registry:
```
npm set registry http://npm-repository.liveramp.net:4873
```

Include `liveramp-ui-toolkit` in your `package.json` dependencies:
```
"liveramp-ui-toolkit": "^0.4.5",
```

Import ui_toolkit components in your React JSX:
```
import { UiHeader, UiTitle, UiProgressMeter } from 'liveramp-ui-toolkit';
```

### Local development

In order to test a component while building it, create a sandbox component under `js/sandboxComponents` and render it in `js/sandbox.jsx`.

In one terminal, start a local webserver:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

In another terminal tab or window, run the continuous compilation:
```
webpack --watch
```

Then navigate to
`localhost:8000/sandbox.html` in your browser.


## General Design Patterns

Whenever possible, we want the components to be **[stateless functional](https://medium.com/@joshblack/stateless-components-in-react-0-14-f9798f8b992d#.fbyf1o6ej) components**. This enforces that the components do not hold state, do not have React lifecycle methods, and they display information received strictly through props. This is not possible in all cases, however.

Charles Francis also wrote a React Best Practices
[document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bDuc4pxM7eSD791mJiBMAhNesl-oZsi_BKPZK-ZFHOY/edit). He is
a good resource if you are in doubt.

## Contributing

### Updating or improving a component

If you would like to improve or update a component, first speak to Connect Core OC and discuss why the
component needs to be changed and how you'd like to change it.  After approval:

  1. Update the component
  2. When finished, create a pull request and assign Connect Core OC (and tag Nora Kako if changes impact the UI)

### Adding a new component to the Ui Toolkit

If you want to add a component to the Ui Toolkit, first make sure that it doesn't already exist in some
form in the toolkit. Many components have multiple functionalities, so there may already be a component
that does what you want to do.

If the component doesn't exist:
  1. Discuss the component and its functionality and design with Connect Core OC and get approval
  2. After approval, create the component with the same format as the other components in js/components
  3. Add a Sandbox version of your component, similar to other components in js/sandboxComponents.
  4. When finished, create a pull request and assign Connect Core OC (and tag Nora Kako if changes impact the UI)
